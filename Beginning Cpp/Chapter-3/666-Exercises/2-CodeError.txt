Task:
-What's wrong with the following code?

       for (int i = 0; i <= phrase.size(); ++i)
{
    cout << "Character at position " << i << " is: " << phrase[i] << endl;
}

Answer:
- the for loops checks <= instead of <
- therefore it is an off by one error
- the array has valid index for 0 to 14
- the last loop iteration will access array index 15 which is undetermined
